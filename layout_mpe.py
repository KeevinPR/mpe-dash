# DEPRECATED: This file has been migrated to dash_mpe.py
# All layout components are now unified in the main dash_mpe.py file
# following the same pattern as other dashboards in the project.
#
# To maintain consistency with dash_mrewithedas.py and dash_probExplainer.py,
# the MPE dashboard now uses a single file structure with:
# - Modern liquid glass CSS styling
# - Session management
# - Notification system  
# - Unified layout and callbacks
#
# This file is kept for reference but is no longer used.

# Legacy layout variable for backward compatibility (empty)
layout = None
